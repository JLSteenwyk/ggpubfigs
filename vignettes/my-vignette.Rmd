ggpubfigs has a set six themes to pick from. Three are for making publication ready figures and three are for presentation purposes:

**Publication ready themes**
* theme_grid()
* theme_simple()
* theme_grey()

**Presentation ready themes**
* theme_black()
* theme_blue()
* theme_red()

These themes can be added to typical ggplot2-based commands.
