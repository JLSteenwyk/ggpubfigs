About
=====

^^^^^

**ggpubfigs** was developed by `Jacob L. Steenwyk <https://jlsteenwyk.github.io/>`_ to
provide publication-ready ggplot2 themes and colorblind-friendly color palettes for the
life sciences.

Making scientific figures accessible to all readers, including those with color vision
deficiencies, is critical for effective science communication. ggpubfigs addresses this
by providing a curated set of colorblind-friendly palettes alongside clean, minimalist
themes designed for publication and presentation.
